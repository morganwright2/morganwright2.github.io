The WOD, Invoice 1, was focused on creating a dynamic sales reciept that has defined variables and equations so that changing the numbers only involves changing the defined versus having to go through the entire HTML and manually changing every number. 

Here is the link to the Invoice 1 WOD page for more details.

In perforning this WOD, the entire process went decently smooth. It felt like everything started to click and it all just made sense. The math equations to compute the total and tax made perfect sense as to why they needed to be exectued that way. Somethings that slowed me down were that the direction of the slashes before a comment matters and the intricacy of finding where to adjust the code when adding the script to the table took me an extra moment. 

What I did to prepare was essentially the exact same as what I have done for all the WOD's so far. I start off by reading the entire assignment. After that I try to get as far as I can in the WOD without the recording and timer to calmly assess the assignment and what I do and do not get without the stress of a time constraint. Judging from how the first attempt, I watch the screencast accordingly to whichever sections confused me or whatever I wanted to verify I did correctly. From there I go to complete the WOD with the timer and recording to submit. This preperation has worked extremely well for me and I intend to continue with the same tactics.

Something I could have done better was slow down so I did not make as many copy and paste errors which resulted in my overall time being longer with the rush rather than being more efficient and percise by taking my time.
