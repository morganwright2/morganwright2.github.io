1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
 https://assignment2-421506.wm.r.appspot.com 
 In assignment 2 we are elevating almost every aspect from assignment 1 to transform the page into something you would typically see when making a purchase online. Every time from logging in/registration to your user data having to follow specific parameters. We also focused on some security aspects to ensure the safety of the site and our other users' data.

2. What did you learn from this assignment?
 From this assignment, I learned that the tasks that seem to be the most grueling and difficult tend to be the easiest and it is just a matter of understanding the code you have and the parameters of that code so you can build off of it. I also learned how much goes into protecting the user's data and pushing the users from one page to the next depending on where they are at in their process.

3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage of the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
 I did not work with a partner so I did this all on my own with some guidance from Professor Port and ChatGTP.

4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
 When I needed help I would first try to have ChatGTP explain what I am confused about and give me some examples. From there if I was still stuck I would message our professor if he knew any quick fixes or we would meet up to work on it. I needed help with my IR4 and getting the data to stay in the query from the store page to the invoice.

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
 This assignment was very different from assignment 1 in the way that the majority of what I was doing was tweaking code to do slightly more advanced things versus in assignment 1 there was much more creating code and functions. This assignment 2 was also different because there were many more parameters we had to set for bad data for example the registration page had a plethora of that. 

6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing), (c) testing and debugging
 (a) For the time I spent thinking how to do something I probably spent around 10 hours. 
 (b) For the time I spent on writing code I probably spent around 15 hours.
 (c) For the time I spent on testing and debugging I probably spent around 10 hours.

7. Describe what worked well with this project. What did not work well?
 What worked well with this project was adding the registration/login page and the parameters set to keep bad data out. What did not go well in this assignment was getting the browser to display some of the dynamic data unique to the user.

8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
 If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would slow down and try to think of things for a minute longer before throwing everything onto VS code. I tend to move my fingers faster than my brain and it comes to bite me later when there is a jumbled mess from me treating my page like a scratch pad rather than the final product.
