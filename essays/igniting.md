Up until a year ago I had no idea that the subject Management Information Systems existed, I always thought it was either business or computer science and no in between. 

After taking ICS 101 and really enjoying the material, I decided to become an ATA for the class to strengthen my knowledge on the subject. Creating the HTML website was so much fun for me and that was when I realized I finally found something I have a passion for. 

At this point I still had no idea the subject MIS existed.

I then met with my counselor and explained how I was feeling and was conflicted to leave the business program for computer science but I knew I wanted something along those lines. This is when I learned of MIS, the perfect combination of business and CS and my mind was instantly set. 

I have always enjoyed the behind the scenes work of how websites and servers work and am so excited to finally being my journey in learninng it all! Although the work can at times be grueling, it is overall extremely satisfying and rewarding.
