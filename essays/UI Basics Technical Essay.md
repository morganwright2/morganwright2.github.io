In doing the Browser History WODs, I realized how beneficial it is to do material over and over again until it finally becomes ingrained in your head. 

In the first workout, Browser History 1, I did not have too hard of a time on this one as I learned most of this material in a previous class, ICS 101, and got a refresher in ITM 352. The biggest problems I faced in this workout were technical difficulties with the actual screen recording and figuring out how to save it into a URL to share with Laulima. I finally figured out the recording using ctrl shift 5 to open up QuickTime Player on my Mac. I then ended up having to post my video as a YouTube video and then taking the link from there to put it into the Laulima submission, which worked but was extremely time-consuming with how long it took to upload and process.

The second workout had me way more stumped than the first because of the addition of the CSS and finding and properly incorporating the font URL into the head of the HTML. I finally figured it out after watching the video time after time that the tag to insert the font URL had to be in its separate tag from the tag to link the HTML and CSS sheet. After debunking that problem, there was the CSS, which is frustrating because when seeing the solution seems so simple but coming up with the proper tags off the top of your head with so many that seem to do the same job is frustrating. After doing the WOD once on my own time with no recording or timer to reduce any stress-produced mistakes, I had to do it a few times over with the recording and times, finding myself stumped on problems that I knew deep down yet the timer prohibited me from deep thinking as I was trying to get the best time possible. Eventually, it all came together and was extremely satisfying to accomplish. 

Lastly, with the third workout, I found myself facing similar problems as I did in the previous workout. The meticulous tags that all seemed the same in my brain mixed with the timer adding anxiety to my performance was difficult but nothing some repetitive practice could not handle. I used my technique of having a stress-free go around first without the timer or recording to wrap my head around what it was I needed to do and then got into the headspace of speed and accuracy. The thing that had me stumped the most was the "a" after the #navbar in the CSS. Although it is so simple my brain could not keep it stuck in my head. My biggest problem is that I find myself quitting halfway through and restarting if I take a little bit longer than I thought I should have on a section. This makes it so the second half of the workout gets less attention and I allow myself to quit easily without pushing myself as hard.

The main solutions I have come to in doing the first three WODs are to allow myself time to think without getting frustrated and giving up and to spend more time analyzing the simple things that will not stick in my brain to fully digest what it does and how to properly use it.
