1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways: I am now gaining confidence in my own opinions and visions in how to complete the problems which is allowing me to progress further. I also can feel my brain starting to automate the simpler tasks instead of having to RTFM for every step to the solution.

2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills: I need to work on not overcomplicating all the tasks and allow myself to trust the simple solutions. I also need to work on the creating and calling of functions to properly use them.

3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast: I would say I have definitely learned a tremendous amount from the WODs because they make me really focus on the problem at hand but Invoice 3 I definitely could have used a screencast. 

4. The labs have helped me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence: The labs have built up my confidence a great deal due to me learning the most from step-by-step processes so being able to absorb all that information and have the opportunity to ask questions as they arise is extremely beneficial.

5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2: I have learned more than I ever would have believed to in Assignment 1 which is shocking. I am a little nervous to move onto Assignment 2 but I am excited to continue learning as I did on the first assignment. 

6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways: I think that having more opportunities like the Assignment 1 workshop class period, where it is free for all of the problems that we are facing and stuck at allows me to soak up more knowledge. 

7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one-on-one help, working with classmates, etc.): What helps me most in class are the screencasts and class website. The screencasts are helpful to me because I am a visual learner so that is where I can learn the most. The class website is also helpful to me because it gives me a central location to find anything I could need for this class which is convenient.
